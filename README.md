# Automated-Football-Data-Pipeline-for-Talent-Insights
# Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end automated data pipeline that transforms raw web data from Sofifa into structured, analytics-ready datasets. It focuses on collecting, cleaning, and standardizing player statistics, market values, and performance metrics to enable data-driven insights for football analysis, talent scouting, and predictive modeling. As a data analyst, this project showcases skills in data engineering, data cleaning, transformation, and analytics, turning unstructured web data into actionable intelligence that informs decision-making in sports analytics. Key Features Web Data Acquisition: Automatically retrieves comprehensive player data from a structured online source. Data Cleaning & Transformation: Converts inconsistent, unstructured values (e.g., wages, market values) into numerical formats suitable for analysis. Analytics-Ready Dataset: Prepares clean, organized datasets ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling. Performance Insights: Enables evaluation of players’ market value, performance metrics, and potential trends for data-driven scouting. Professional Data Workflow: Demonstrates robust data pipeline design that ensures high-quality, accurate datasets. Why This Project Matters Football clubs, analysts, and scouts rely on structured, timely, and accurate data to make strategic decisions.
